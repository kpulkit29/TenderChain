# TenderChain
TenderChain is basically a government project monitoring app built on the top of ethereum blockchain.The companies first send their proposal through our Android app .The address of the company which gets the tenders is displayed to which government assigns a budget through ethers.The company can then use those ethers to make purchases required to complete the project.Moreover the distributor or the material provider would have have an account on ethereum which in turn would be displayed on the web portal.Futher the purchases would be made in ethers.And thanks to blockchain all this would be public and misuse of money would be reduced.Also TenderChain have automated the process of proposal selection of company by applying Machine Learning(Advanced random forests).
